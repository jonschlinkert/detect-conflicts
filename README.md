# detect-conflicts [![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/detect-conflicts.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/detect-conflicts)

> Check for conflicts, and get prompted for action (when needed), before writing a file to disk.

Some of this code is based on the [conflicter in yeoman-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator) and the [visual diff method in verb](https://github.com/verbose/verb).

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

```sh
$ npm i detect-conflicts --save
```

## Usage

```js
var detect = require('detect-conflicts');

var file = {path: 'fixtures/a.txt', contents: 'aaa'};
detect(file, function (res) {
  // `res` would be a user response. we'll only get to this
  // point if the user chooses not to abort. 
});
```
